### [Biometric-Facial-Recognition](https://github.com/srishtipmishra/Biometric-Facial-Recognition)

This involves extraction of its features and then recognizes it, regardless of lighting, ageing, occlusion, expression, illumination and pose.
Principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis are tested and compared for the face recognition of facial images database.
The proposed algorithm is based on the measure of the principal components of the faces and also to find the shortest distance between them.

### [Noise-Cancellation-using-adaptive-filter](https://github.com/srishtipmishra/Handwriting-Neural-Network)

This Project involves the study of the principles of Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC). Adaptive noise Cancellation is an
alternative technique of estimating signals corrupted by additive noise or interference. In this, we donâ€™t need a priori
estimates of signal or noise, levels of noise rejection are attainable that would be difficult or impossible to achieve
by other signal processing methods of removing noise.
