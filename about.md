After completing my Bachelor's in Engineering in Computer Science back in 2014 from one of the most renowned universities
VTU, I worked with ABB, Robotics for 2 years as a software developer. I consider myself lucky to have had an opportunity
so early in my career to be a part of a product's core development team. It helped me hone my coding skills as well as
understand the intricacies of a software including its business value on an organizational level.Had an opportunity to
work with some extremely seasoned developers from India and Sweden.

Currently in the 1st term of my Masters in Computer Science at University of Florida with a focus on Machine Learning.
My courses include Analysis of Algorithms, Math for Intelligent Systems and Elements of Machine Intelligence.

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading up on anything i can get my hands on. However, i enjoy satire, political pieces.
I love watch historic speeches. I also like to travel and have traveled across most parts of India.
